- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Initialize the application**:
   ```bash
   python init.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Create necessary directories
   - Set up the database
   - Create an admin user
   - Set up default scoring weights

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

The application can be configured using environment variables or by editing the configuration section in the `app.py` file.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Secret key for session security | dev_key_replace_in_production |
| `SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT` | Salt for password security | salt_replace_in_production |
| `MAIL_SERVER` | SMTP server for sending emails | smtp.example.com |
| `MAIL_PORT` | SMTP port | 587 |
| `MAIL_USE_TLS` | Use TLS for email | True |
| `MAIL_USERNAME` | SMTP username | user@example.com |
| `MAIL_PASSWORD` | SMTP password | password |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Default admin password | admin |

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Analyzing Resumes

1. Log in to your account
2. Click on "Analyze Resumes" in the navigation bar
3. Enter the job title and job description
4. Upload one or more resumes (PDF, DOCX, DOC, or TXT format)
5. Select scoring weights (or use the default)
6. Click "Analyze Resumes"
7. View the results showing the best matches

### Managing Scoring Weights

1. Navigate to "Scoring Weights" in the dashboard
2. Click "Create New Weights"
3. Set custom values for skills, education, experience, and certifications (must sum to 1.0)
4. Save your custom weights
5. Use them in future analyses

### Viewing Analysis History

1. Navigate to "Analysis History" in the dashboard
2. View all previous analyses with timestamps and job titles
3. Click on any analysis to view detailed results
4. Export results in various formats

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Text Extraction**: The system extracts text from uploaded resume files
2. **Preprocessing**: Both the resume text and job description are preprocessed using NLP techniques
3. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization is used to extract features
4. **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity is calculated between each resume and the job description
5. **Weighted Scoring**: Custom weights are applied to different aspects of the match
6. **Results Visualization**: Results are displayed with detailed breakdowns and visualizations
